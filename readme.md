# First project
My first repository on github. Trying to learn git and all the functions in command-line.

### Testing remotes, yeaah.
### The testing goes on.. Seems to work.

# New branch
1. Testing to merge another branch in to master.
2. Testing to merge another branch in to master.

# Merging
Merge should've worked just fine!
